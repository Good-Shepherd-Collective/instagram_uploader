  Today we remember Palestinians killed by Israeli forces on August 31st across multiple years—just a fraction of lives lost in the ongoing erasure of indigenous Palestinians. This violence isn't random; it's the systematic machinery of settler colonialism, where capitalism drives land theft and indigenous communities become obstacles to be removed for profit and expansion. On this day, Israeli soldiers killed 6-year-old Bahira Daraghmeh with helicopter missiles in Tubas (2002). They killed 12-year-old Ousamah Daraghmeh in the same attack. Israeli forces also shot 15-year-old Muhammad Sinuqrut in the head with a sponge round in East Jerusalem (2014). They shot 15-year-old Muhammad 'Alian near Beit El settlement and killed him in 2009. Israeli forces also killed teenagers Yazid Daraghmeh (17) and Sari Subuh (17) in 2002. On this date across the years, Israeli forces killed 17 Palestinians documented here—from 6-year-old Bahira to 48-year-old Hassan Barakat. The violence concentrated in Tubas (5 killed in a single 2002 helicopter attack targeting one person), refugee camps including Jenin and Balata, and occupied territories from Nablus to Gaza. Each name represents a family destroyed, a community grieving, and the relentless colonial project that treats Palestinian life as disposable in pursuit of territorial expansion and control.
