  Palestinian homes aren't just being demolished—they're being systematically erased at an accelerating pace. 2024 saw 4,293 people displaced through 554 demolition operations. We're on track for 2,343 displaced in 2025, with Israeli forces conducting 1.57 demolitions daily.

  This isn't random violence—it's textbook settler colonialism. Like the Trail of Tears, the Algerian expulsions, or Australian frontier wars, the goal is to make Indigenous life impossible. Capitalism demands "empty" land for development, turning Palestinian suffering into Israeli real estate profits.
  
  Eight people including 4 children lost their agricultural shelter in Az Za'ayyem Bedouin community on Aug 26—no warning given. In Al Walaja, a man was forced to destroy his own livelihood structure to save his water cistern underneath, while soldiers watched. A young couple in Al-'Isawiya saw their 90m² future home demolished just before their wedding.

  The cruelty is deliberate: families must destroy their own homes or face bankruptcy from fines. Since 2009, over 21,000 Palestinians have been displaced through 4,810 documented demolitions. Each rubble pile represents a family's memories, a community's roots, a people's right to exist on their ancestral land.

  This is the arithmetic of ethnic cleansing—one family, one home, one village at a time. But Palestinian steadfastness (sumud) persists. Every rebuilt home is resistance. Every family that stays is defiance.
